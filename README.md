[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CodeCharmLtd/node-cbind.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CodeCharmLtd/node-cbind)

Streamlined automatic C/C++ v8 bindings generator for Node.JS inspired by tolua++ (requires C++11)

Core idea is the ability to easily bind to C/C++ by providing a header-like description of the native interface that is a subset of C++ (format is called Native Interface Description https://github.com/CodeCharmLtd/NID):

Simple things:
```c++

int global_variable;

std::string global_function(int a, float b);

struct Rect {
  int x;
  int y;
  int w;
  int h;
};
bool rectangles_intersect(Rect a, Rect b);

```

More complex things:
```c++
#include <stdio.h>

int errno; // make errno available as getter and setter

// make fopen available and mark FILE* pointers for automatic closing when gced
FILE * [[free(fclose)]] fopen(const char* filename, const char* mode);

// make fread available and automatically set one of its arguments
size_t fread(void* ptr [[buffer]], size_t size, size_t nmemb [[set(ptr.length / size)]], FILE* stream [[handle]]);

// tell cbind to mark the object containing pointer as invalid
int fclose(FILE* f [[clear_free,unref]]);
```



## Supported and tested features

* Handling basic types int, float, double, char*, const char*, std::string
* Handling pointers to basic types. Contains functions to create pointer values and dereference them.
* Binding to global variables with getter/setter.
* Binding to global functions.
* Type checking that throws exception to javascript in case of unmatched types.
* Attributes for specifying automatic free of returned arguments.
* Attributes for handling input buffer automatically and passing it to javascript as a return value.

## Implemented and initially tested

* Handle binary buffers as Buffer.
* Handling function pointer types. Function pointers are automatically converted to javascript functions and vice-versa. Function pointer variables as getter/setters and function pointers as arguments are equally handled.
* Handling constructors of structs/classes and binding them to javascript new.
* Handling class/struct variables and methods.
* Passing struct and class pointers to arbitrary functions.

## Planned features

* Attributes for calling native code asynchronously and returning values as promises (bluebird).
* Attributes for automatically handling native callbacks that have returned from a separate thread.

## Requirements

* C++11 support (GCC 4.8 or clang 3.3)
* Node 0.8, 0.10 or 0.11.13+

## How-to use

* `npm install --save cbind`
* Create `example.nid` file
Put your native interface definition there, for example:

```
void hello(int b);
```

* Have your `binding.gyp` follow this example:
```
{
  "targets": [
    {
      "target_name": "cbind_example",
      "sources": [
        "src/addon.cc"
      ],
      "include_dirs"  : [
          "<!(node -e \"require('nan')\" 2> /dev/null)",
          "<!(node -e \"require('cbind')('example.nid')\" 2> /dev/null)"
      ],
      "cflags": ["-g", "-std=c++11"],
			"cflags_cc!": [ '-fno-exceptions' ]
    }
  ]
}
```
* Have your `addon.cc` the following content
```c++

#include <cstdio>

void hello(int a) {
  printf("Hello world: %i\n", a);
}

#include <cbind_example.h>

void init(v8::Handle<v8::Object> exports) {
  
  cbind::init_example(exports);
}

NODE_MODULE(tov8_example, init);
```

* Run `node-gyp rebuild`

* With hello.js having the following content:
```
var bindings = require('./build/Release/cbind_example.node');
bindings = hello(42);
```

* `node hello.js` should print "Hello world 42`

The above is in the repository https://github.com/CodeCharmLtd/cbind-example


Please open issues or follow example tests. README will be gradually expanded.
